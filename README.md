A new Premier League analyst joins the conversation. He's just a few years out of date.

## Objective

The goal of this project was to design and ship an AI-powered assistant end-to-end â€” from model prompting and data sourcing to frontend interaction and UX polish.

## Sources

I used [Vercel's AI SDK](https://ai-sdk.dev/docs/introduction) with OpenAI's `gpt-4o` as provider and model, respectively.

Football data is gathered from [Api-Football](https://www.api-football.com/documentation-v3), though I had to limit the scope of this assistant to the Premier League from 2021-2023 due to the restrictions of the API's free tier and limitations of time and complexity of handling multiple leagues.
